# TODO for Up and Away

+ **Current bugs:**

	+ Characters lose equipped items on climbing beanstalk. (Cannot reproduce; was reported by tester using a large number of mods.)
	+ Staves are non-functional in DST due to test fn.
	+ Ambience is non-functional in DS.

+ **Art assets in need of attention**

	+ Check our [dedicated TODO list](TODO_ART.md).

+ **Code assets in need of attention**

	+ Add ambiant sound to the cloudrealm. Sounds now exist in mod files.
	+ Reputation component needs decay functionality.
	+ Winnie lureplant recipe (waiting for Klei recipe implementation.)
	+ Bean Giant is being overhauled.	
	+ Shopkeeper Boss Quest implementation.
	+ Gnomes are being overhauled.
	+ Add a slight visual effect to static damage.
	+ Port golden egg corruption to DST.
	+ Superconductor implementation.
	+ Unique item implementation.

+** Strings in need of attention**

	+ Red Jellycap missing strings.

+ **General improvements to be made:*

	+ Allow for more cloud stuff in the overworld, and vice-versa.

+ **Miscellanea (Suggestions to be considered) **

	+ Clockwork biome: http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/27648-suggestions-cauldron-of-ideas/?p=507711 (This is something I've thought more about. The player should have something more easily relateable once they make some progress in the Cloudrealm. Doesn't have to be clockwork stuff necessarily. Consider it pavlovion. Not that I want the mod to become a skinner-box, but that kind of attribute is necessary to a point in design and balance.)

	+ Stuffed animals that can be created with the sewing kit. They start as a cotton frame, and become a random stuffed animal when sewn. They give very small amounts of sanity and warmth when used.

	+ Rhinomen confirmed. http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/19488-dont-starve-supermod-mod-abandoned/page-47#entry192646

Anything else that needs to be added will be added (eventually).
