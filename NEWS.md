<!--
This is a comment block.

I converted the NEWS file to Markdown, so they can more easily be read from GitHub.
The nice thing about Markdown is that its syntax is very natural (being converted
to HTML). In fact, the original version from debugman18 was pretty much Markdown
already. Just avoid underscores, since they have a special meaning in MD.

Read this file in the GitHub code browser to see how it looks like (and how it's
much better than just plain text).

This link has some nice info on Markdown: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown

I'm prefixing the list of changes by date, since I suppose we'll remain at prealpha
for quite some time.
